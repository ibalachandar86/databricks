Excellent — you’re essentially asking:

“In PySpark, can I trigger multiple child Python scripts (like separate .py files) from a master Python script using ThreadPoolExecutor, where each behaves like dbutils.notebook.run() — i.e., runs independently, in parallel, and returns success/failure messages?”

✅ Yes, you can absolutely do this — but you need to be clear whether:

all scripts run inside the same Spark session (driver), or
you want to run them as independent subprocesses (like separate notebook runs).
Let’s cover both cases 👇

🧩 OPTION 1: Run child scripts as subprocesses (closest to dbutils.notebook.run)
This approach truly simulates dbutils.notebook.run() — each child .py file runs in its own Python process, isolated from the master.
You can parallelize them using ThreadPoolExecutor.

✅ Example Structure
/Shared/
 ├── master_program.py
 ├── child_script_1.py
 ├── child_script_2.py
🧠 master_program.py
import subprocess
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

def run_child(script_name, args=None):
    """
    Run a child python script as a subprocess and capture its output
    """
    cmd = ["python", script_name]
    if args:
        cmd.extend(args)
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        return (script_name, "SUCCESS", result.stdout.strip())
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return (script_name, "FAILED", e.stderr.strip())

# List of child scripts with parameters
child_jobs = [
    ("child_script_1.py", ["paramA", "123"]),
    ("child_script_2.py", ["paramB", "456"]),
]

results = []
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(run_child, s, a) for s, a in child_jobs]
    for f in as_completed(futures):
        results.append(f.result())

for r in results:
    print(f"Script: {r[0]} | Status: {r[1]} | Message: {r[2]}")
🧠 child_script_1.py
import sys
import time

param1 = sys.argv[1]
param2 = sys.argv[2]

print(f"Child script started with params: {param1}, {param2}")
time.sleep(2)  # Simulate processing
print("Child script finished successfully.")
✅ Output
Script: child_script_1.py | Status: SUCCESS | Message: Child script started with params: paramA, 123 ...
Script: child_script_2.py | Status: SUCCESS | Message: Child script started with params: paramB, 456 ...
⚙️ Notes
Each subprocess runs independently (like dbutils.notebook.run()).
You can capture both stdout and stderr.
Works fine on Databricks if .py scripts are in DBFS or local driver path.
🧩 OPTION 2: Run functions inside the same Spark session (shared context)
If you want to parallelize ETL functions (not separate files), you can define a function and submit it with threads.

from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

def run_child_task(task_name):
    print(f"Starting task {task_name}")
    df = spark.range(1000000).withColumnRenamed("id", task_name)
    count = df.count()
    return f"Task {task_name} processed {count} records"

tasks = ["A", "B", "C"]

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(run_child_task, t) for t in tasks]
    for f in as_completed(futures):
        print(f.result())
✅ Advantages:

All threads share the same SparkSession.
Good for light parallelism (metadata-driven orchestration).
⚠️ Caution: Spark actions (.count(), .show()) are thread-safe but will queue jobs; true Spark parallelism happens inside the cluster, not via Python threads.

🧩 OPTION 3: Hybrid — call child .py scripts using Databricks REST API
If you’re in Databricks and want to mimic dbutils.notebook.run() fully, you can trigger Python scripts (or notebooks) as Databricks jobs using the REST API.

That gives:

Parallel isolation
Job tracking
Cluster management
Return values
(Equivalent to what dbutils.notebook.run() does but from Python.)

🧠 Summary Table
Goal	Approach	Runs in same SparkSession?	Parallel?	Isolation
Simulate dbutils.run() behavior	subprocess.run() inside ThreadPool	❌	✅	✅
Run Python functions in parallel	ThreadPoolExecutor on functions	✅	⚠️ (light)	❌
Production-level parallel notebook/script orchestration	Databricks REST API / Jobs API	❌	✅	✅✅
Would you like me to show a metadata-driven version of Option 1 — where the master reads task info from a metadata table and triggers multiple .py scripts in parallel (like ETL jobs)?
